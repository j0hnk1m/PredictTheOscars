# Project PTO - Building a Computer Algorithm to Predict the Oscars

## Overview
This project was a month-long side project I did for my highschool final project. PTO is a computer algorithm using machine learning and data science to determine which movies will be oscar nominees and winners. I have created a flexible dataset for anyone in the community to try and get better results!

A jupyter notebook is also included in this repo explaining in detail my process.

## Contents
The project consists of 4 major sections: 
1. Data Collection
2. Data Manipulation/Organization
3. The Algorithm
4. Algorithm Optimization

# Project PTO - Building a Computer Algorithm to Predict the Oscars
This project was a month-long side project I did for my highschool final project. PTO is a computer algorithm using machine learning and data science to determine which movies will be oscar nominees and winners.

The project consists of 4 major sections: 
1. Data Collection
2. Data Manipulation/Organization
3. The Algorithm
4. Algorithm Optimization
